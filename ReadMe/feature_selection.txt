feature_selection.r script performs feature selection procedure for both categorical and numerical attributes of the given data.

Functions:
1) variance
    Objective <- Find average variance of the complete attribute, using multiple samples
  	Input <- Data, Column Name
  	Output <- Variance
  	Approach <- Compute Variance for for different samples(approximately 1%) and the return the Average
                Variance for all, to get an appropriate assumption of complete attribute

2) information_gain
    Objective <- Find Entropy of the complete attribute
  	Input <- Data, Column Name, Label
  	Output <- Information gain
  	Approach <- Find the Number of Levels within the given Categorical Attribute and then calculate the Parent and Combined Child Entropy.                 Child Entropy is calculated by dividing the given data set into levels defined in the attribute and then calculating                       Entropy for each. Finally, return the difference between both the calculated entropy i.e. Information Gain

3) selection 
    Objective <- Select Features from data on basis of defined Criteria
  	Input <- Data & Label
  	Output <- Data with only selected features and Label
  	Approach <- It inputs the DataSet and performs the following tasks:
  		          a) Determining Numeric and Categorical Attribute to perform feature selection functions on each seperately.
                  b) Finding the list of Attributes with feature selection value greater than 0.
                  c) Finally, extracing the selected attributes and returning the updated dataset.

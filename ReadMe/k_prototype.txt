k_prototype.R script performs the Specified K-Prototype Clustering Algorithm.

Functions:
1) getDistance
	Objective <- Calculate the Similarity Distance for both Numerical & Categorical attributes.
	Input <- Complete Cluster, Center Point and Point(to get distance from).
	Output <- Combine Numerical & Categorical Distance
	Approach <- It calculates the Distance between the Centroid and the Point using two techniques:
				  a) For Numerical Attributes: Euclidean Distance
				  b) For Categorical Attributes: Chi-Square Distance

2) computeCentroid
	Objective <- Calculate the Centroid for the given Cluster Set
  	Input <- Cluster Set & Class Label
  	Output <- Centroid
  	Approach <- Centroid is calculated by finding:
  				  a)Mean for Numerical Attributes
  				  b)Mode for Categorical Attributes	

3) clusterConfidence
	Objective <- Return the Class Label with Highest Confidence
	Input <- Cluster & Class Label
	Output <- Single Valued Class Label
	Approach <- Finds the frequency of each Class Label within the created Cluster and return the class label 			  with maximum frequency

4) k_cluster
	Objective <- Create a Clustering Model using K-Prototype Clustering Techinque
	Input <- Refined trainSet, Maximum no of Iterations, Weight for Distance
	Output <- Details of 2 defined Clusters
	Approach <- k-prototype algorithm performs the following tasks:
				  a) Selects 2 random points within the data as Centroids of 2 clusters
				  b) Defines the Cluster on the basis of above selected Centroids
				  c) ReCompute the Centroids for the newly created Clusters
				  d) Repeat task b) & c) for the specified number of iterations
				  e) Finally, append the Cluster Label (clusterConfidence) to each of the Centroid and return the details of the Clusters

predict.R performs the task of prediction and calculating the varies performance measures of k-prototype model created in the previous step

Functions
1) predict
	Objective <- Predict the Complete testSet using the given model
	Input <- Model, Test Set, Label
	Output <- List of all Predicted Labels
	Approach <- Predicts the class label for complete test data in following steps:
				  a) Extracts the Class Labels and Centroids from the given Model
				  b) Finds the distance of a point from all Centroids and assign Class Label of closest centroid
				  c) Repeat task b) for all points and return the list for all prediction

2) confusionMatrix
    Objective <- Create a Confusion Matrix with the given predicted and original class labels
  	Input <- Predicted Labels & Original Labels
  	Output <- List contaning the following information:
  				a) Confustion Matrix
  				b) Accuracy
  				c) Error Rate
  				d) True Positive Rate
  				e) False Positive Rate
  				f) Precision 
  	Approach <- Finds all the information listed above in following steps:
  				  a) Creates a Confusion Matrix with help of predicted and original Class Labels
  				  b) Find other Performance measure with help of Confusion Matrix

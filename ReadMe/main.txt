main.R script is the main frame controller for the complete Specified K-Prototype Clustering Algorithm.

It performs the following task:
a) Read the data using the input.R source file
b) Performs feature selection using feature_selection.R source file
c) Distributes the data into Training & Test Sets
d) Creates model with help of Training Set using k_prototype.R source file
e) Predict the Class Label for Test Set and get performance measure for the algorithm
